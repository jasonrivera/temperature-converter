# Temperature Converter

This is a temperature converter that converts Fahrenheit to both Celsius & Kelvin. 

The idea for this project came from the Traversy Media YouTube channel. 

### Source:

[Simple Weight Converter App With JavaScript & Bootstrap 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l-ZAuU8TXc)


## Languages/Tech Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 4


## What I changed:

I turned the project from a weight converter into a temperature converter. 

I kept the HTML, CSS & JavaScript in their own files.

I changed the look of the UI instead of the default Bootstrap 4 styles as in the project from the video.

I organized the JavaScript code into my own style and modified the logic a bit from the original project.

I also added in a CSS Animation library for a small effect.
